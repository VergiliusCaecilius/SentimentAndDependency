it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
i go to far too many places and i've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine.	0
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
it was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
that said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1
what i really like there is the crepe station.	1
this place is two thumbs up....way up.	1
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
i ordered albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
soggy and not good.	0
it's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
i dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
con: spotty service.	0
it was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
the macarons here are insanely good.	1
i would recommend saving room for this!	1
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional hunan style".	0
overall, i like this place a lot.	1
we loved the place.	1
the patio seating was very comfortable.	1
anyway, this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1
-my order was not correct.	0
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
not my thing.	0
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted.	0
so absolutley fantastic.	1
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly.	1
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
generous portions and great taste.	1
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh.)	0
i also had to taste my mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
it's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
everything was perfect the night we were in.	1
what happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
total waste of time.	0
a fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it.	1
it was way over fried.	0
this place was such a nice surprise!	1
food arrived quickly!	1
the only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
which are small and not worth the price.	0
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho.	0
i dont think i will be back for a very long time.	0
similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
the owner used to work at nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe, i was wildly disappointed.	0
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1
i will not be eating there again.	0
won't go back.	0
the veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
first - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
it's a great place and i highly recommend it.	1
on the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1
good food , good service .	1
the food is about on par with denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
if you haven't gone here go now!	1
in the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
i'm not eating here!	0
will go back next trip out.	1
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0

i don't each much pasta, but i love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast.	1
i've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from jenni pho.	0
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm, our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
some highlights : great quality nigiri here!	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1

i'm super pissd.	0
great brunch spot.	1
i tried the cape cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1
i did not expect this to be so good!	1

pretty awesome place.	1
however, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's.	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
the food wasn't good.	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
hell no will i go back	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
extremely tasty!	1
we'd definitely go back here again.	1
great pizza and salads!	1
all i have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
they were excellent.	1
back to good bbq, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare, but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best.	0
but then they came back cold.	0
the atmosphere here is fun.	1
restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
bland... not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. i'll leave it at that...	0
host staff were, for lack of a better word, bitches!	0
my friend did not like his bloody mary.	0
don't do it!!!!	0
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
pretty cool i would say.	1
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho!	1
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas.	1
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
no allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
my friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
same evening, him and i are both drastically sick.	0
this place is amazing!	1
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1
terrible service!	0
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had!	1
great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
it was awesome.	1
there was hardly any meat.	0
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman.	1
if it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad.	0
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm.	0
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
left very frustrated.	0
then, as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
