fantastic food!	1
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
the menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
it'll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix!	1
needless to say, i won't be going back anytime soon.	0
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
in an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	1
the live music on fridays totally blows.	0
it was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
high-quality chicken on the chicken caesar salad.	1
but i don't like it.	0
so don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
lordy, the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
both great!	1
went for lunch - service was slow.	0
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
we had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1

i probably won't be coming back here.	0
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
service was very prompt.	1
good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
as for the service: i'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1
first time there and might just be the last.	0
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
waiter was a jerk.	0
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
great service and food.	1
best buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
i don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
total letdown, i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee.	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
the potato chip order was sad... i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
they really want to make your experience a good one.	1
what should have been a hilarious, yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
we got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
disappointing experience.	0
the warm beer didn't help.	0
if you look for authentic thai food, go else where.	0
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1
sooooo good!!	1
omelets are to die for!	1
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
the food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
i just wanted to leave.	0
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1
great subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations.	1
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back!	1
the staff was very attentive.	1
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	1
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
tasted like dirt.	0
the goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what flavor!	1
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	1
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
i'm so happy to be here!!!"	1
talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	1
all in all, i can assure you i'll be back.	1
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	1
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer.	0
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
for about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
the staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1
the service was outshining & i definitely recommend the halibut.	1
service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again.	0
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
the guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1
in fact i'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
never had anything to complain about here.	1
i think not again	0
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
if the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
on the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
they also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1
very good lunch spot.	1
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened.	0
those burgers were amazing.	1
great place fo take out or eat in.	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
also, i feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
the service was terrible though.	0
crust is not good.	0
all of the tapas dishes were delicious!	1
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
the decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
my fiancã© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
shrimp- when i unwrapped it (i live only 1/2 a mile from brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
i've had better atmosphere.	0
then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
and it was way to expensive.	0
in summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
i would not recommend this place.	0
eew... this location needs a complete overhaul.	0
overall, i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too.	0
i give it 2 thumbs down	0
service sucks.	0
always a great time at dos gringos!	1
- they never brought a salad we asked for.	0
the shrimp tender and moist.	1
i had strawberry tea, which was good.	1
the burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
the chains, which i'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
this was like the final blow!	0
the chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1
i could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
the service was not up to par, either.	0
nice ambiance.	1
update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
i do love sushi, but i found kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
food was really boring.	0
now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
i probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
to summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
i had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1
pretty good beer selection too.	1
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
it was just not a fun experience.	1
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to.	1
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
the steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago!	1
ambience is perfect.	1
